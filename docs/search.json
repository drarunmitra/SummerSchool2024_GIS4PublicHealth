    "text": "Welcome to the Day 3 and 4 of The Summer School Open Stack - Geospatial Models for Public Health!\nThe goal for these two days is to highlight the applications of GIS in Public Health while providing the foundational concepts in Spatial Epidemiology.\nThe workshop introduces the participants to the field of Spatial Data Science through the statistical programming language R.\nThe workshop is intended as an introductory window into the world of spatial data analysis and visualization for better public health outcomes.\nWorkshop materials can be accessed from the github repository GIS4EPI-Workshop\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand Essential Concepts in Spatial Epidemiology\nGet the “bigger” picture of Spatial Data Science - inculcate Geographic/Spatial Thinking\nCreate interest in Spatial Data Science (We do not aim to teach you everything, rather, we want motivate you to learn on your own, so you can fill the gaps in your knowledge)\nLearn about the Best Practices for Reproducible Spatial Data Research and Analysis\nGain hands-on experience with spatial data analysis and visualization (The lab-work is DIY. It is designed to bring you out of your comfort zone and initiate discussions and dialogue)"
